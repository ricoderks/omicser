# Quickstart: NDCN -Omics Browser 

# TODO: 
- add links between teh headings and to the files referenced.

## Overview

These _quickstart_ materials are intended to quickly help a user / curator get the NDCN Omics browser up and running.  Contained in this directory are a sequence of vignettes which detail each step of:

1. [Environment Setup](01_environment_setup.md)
2. [Installation](02_install.md)
3. [Data Curation](03_data_curation.md)
4. [Configuration](04_configuration.md)
5. [Browsing](05_browsing.md)

There is also a subdirectory of [`examples/`](examples/) which have some R-scripts used to curate and execute example datasets, and _stubs_ to some directories holding the curated _DATABASE_ examples and configuration files (e.g. [`omicser_options.yml`](omicser_options.yml))
