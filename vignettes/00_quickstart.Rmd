These *Quickstart* materials are intended to guide curators through the process of creating their own web application and formatting data for visualization in the browser.
The main vignettes in the Quickstart series include:

1. [Environment Setup](01_environment_setup.md)
2. [Installation](02_install.md)
3. [Data Curation](03_data_curation.md)
4. [Configuration](04_configuration.md)
5. [Browsing](05_browsing.md)

There is also a subdirectory of [`examples/`](examples/) which have some R-scripts used to curate and execute example datasets, and _stubs_ to some directories holding the curated _DATABASE_ examples and configuration files (e.g. [`omicser_options.yml`](omicser_options.yml))
