# Omicser Contribution and Governance Policies

This document describes the contribution process and governance policies of the NDCN Omicser project.  As this project aims to solve for a broad set of needs across the NDCN community there will need to be honest and thoughtful discussion around features and priorities.

## Contribution Process
Before making a contribution, please take the following steps:
1. Check whether there's already an open issue related to your proposed contribution. If there is, join the discussion and propose your contribution there.
2. If there isn't already a relevant issue, create one, describing your contribution and the problem you're trying to solve.
3. Respond to any questions or suggestions raised in the issue by other developers.
4. Fork the project repository and prepare your proposed contribution.
5. Submit a pull request.

NOTE: All contributors are implicitly sharing open license to the code submitted.  See also our [CONTRIBUTION document](https://github.com/ndcn/omicser/CONTRIBUTION.md)


## Governance

### Roles

The project community consists of Contributors and Maintainers:
* A **Contributor** is anyone who submits a contribution to the project. (Contributions may include code, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above.)
* A **Maintainer** is a Contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given write access to project repositories and may merge approved contributions.
* The **Lead Maintainer** is the project's interface with the CZI/NDCN team and Board. They are responsible for communicating to the CZI/NDCN Community on behalf of the project. The Lead Maintainer is elected by a vote of the Maintainers. 
* A **NDCN/CZI executor** whom is responsible to CZI/NDCN interests and solely has the power to rename, delete, or suspend the repo.

### Contribution Rules

Anyone is welcome to submit a contribution to the project. The rules below apply to all contributions. (The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc. in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).)

* All contributions MUST be submitted as pull requests, including contributions by Maintainers.
* All pull requests SHOULD be reviewed by a Maintainer (other than the Contributor) before being merged.
* Pull requests for non-trivial contributions SHOULD remain open for a review period sufficient to give all Maintainers a sufficient opportunity to review and comment on them.
* After the review period, if no Maintainer has an objection to the pull request, any Maintainer MAY merge it.
* If any Maintainer objects to a pull request, the Maintainers SHOULD try to come to consensus through discussion. If not consensus can be reached, any Maintainer MAY call for a vote on the contribution.

### Maintainer Voting 
Its a democracy... sort of.  The project will fork if we ever get here, and ultimately a **NDCN Executor** can make a call.  But:

The Maintainers MAY hold votes only when they are unable to reach consensus on an issue. 
The Maintainers SHALL decide the following matters by consensus or, if necessary, a vote:
* Contested pull requests
* Election and removal of the Lead Maintainer
* Election and removal of Maintainers

All Maintainer votes MUST be carried out transparently, with all discussion and voting occurring in public, either:
* in comments associated with the relevant issue or pull request, if applicable;
* on the project mailing list or other official public communication channel; or
* during a regular, minuted project meeting.

### Maintainer Qualifications/Responsibility
Any Contributor who has made a substantial contribution to the project MAY apply (or be nominated) to become a Maintainer. This would require assuming additional _responsibilities_, and SHOULD win them great grattitude.


### Changes to this Document
This document MAY be amended by a consensus of the **Contributors** and **Maintainers** .
