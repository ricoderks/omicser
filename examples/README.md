# Example files for `omicser` development

If you would like to test the NDCN Omics Browser with example data,
we recommend starting with our example script for 
[PBMC data from 10 Genomics](browse_pbmc3k.R).

Additional scripts include:

- `install_script.R`: installs R and Python packages, creates environment 
- example curation files for various data types:
  - `curate_domenico_stem_cell.R`: proteomics
  - `curate_vilas_microglia.R`: single-cell transcriptomics
  - `curate_yassene_lipids.R`: lipidomics

Example files include:

- `raw_data/` and `test_db/`: placeholders for locations to put data and database files, respectively
- `omicser_options.yml`: example configuration file for a browser with multiple databases

Files not listed here are used by project developers and are not intended for other users.
