## Introduction

The goal of this package is to allow exploration of -omics data using
an interactive "playground" (e.g., Shiny application),
accessible through an interactive web browser.
In addition to the browser package, 
this project includes documentation about usage, 
example scripts, 
and an expository quickstart tutorial to demonstrate how it is to be used.
The browser package itself contains the code to create/run the browser,
as well as a small collection of helper functions to aid in curating and configuring datasets for browsing.

> *Note*:  although the NDCN browser is not yet officially named, there are references to the browser/package as `omicser` or `omxr`.

There are two types of users for this package:

- **Curators**: data analysts who configure the app and prepare datasets for viewing. These individuals should be fairly proficient with R coding, including familiarity with building Shiny apps and knowledgeable about -omics data structures.
- **Viewers**: scientists who are interested in exploring -omics data using the application. They do not require extensive knowledge about R, but may need to have it installed if they are running the app on their own computer.

The diagram below summarizes the steps required to use this package:

Support for the following _post-QC_ -omics data types has been tested:

- _transcript_-omics
- _prote_-omics
- _metabol_-omics
- _lipid_-omics

The package is able to provide the following outputs:

- images visualizing data
- subsets of data
- web application packaged with data that can be shared with collaborators, so they can run the browser on their own computer

## Installation and usage for Viewers

Once a curator has prepared the data and configured the application,
the package can be installed with R:

```{r, 00-install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ndcn/omicser")
library(omicser)
```

And then then the browser can be launched:

```{r, 01-launch, eval=FALSE}
omicser::run_app()
```

For more information on launching the web application with your data,
please consult with the Curator who created it.

## Installation and usage for Curators

This package was developed to create a [`{shiny}`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application using  
[`{golem}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem), "an opinionated framework for building production-grade shiny applications."
It requires a number of additional R and Python packages.  The package creates the Shiny browser app as well as several functions for curating and packaging the data being curated.

Documentation to walk through the process of installing necessary software, creating your application, and browsing your data is available in the [Quickstart guide](https://ndcn.github.io/omicser/articles/00_quickstart.html):

- [**1-Set up environment**](https://ndcn.github.io/omicser/articles/01_environment_setup.html): ensure underlying tools/packages from R and python are available 
- [**2-Install package**](https://ndcn.github.io/omicser/articles/02_install.html): includes data curation functions and software that runs the browser application
- [**3-Curate data**](https://ndcn.github.io/omicser/articles/03_data_curation.html): the _-omics_ data curated into a _database_
- [**4-Configure application**](https://ndcn.github.io/omicser/articles/04_configuration.html): connecting the _-omics database_ to the browser app
- [**5-Browse data**](https://ndcn.github.io/omicser/articles/05_browsing.html): explore the data, test hypotheses, create visualizations
- [**6-Share application**](https://ndcn.github.io/omicser/articles/06_sharing.html): perform final curation steps that allow you to share the browser with collaborators (Viewers)

Please view the [examples directory of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ndcn/omicser/tree/main/examples)
for this project to view additional files used in the Quickstart.
