# WORK IN PROGRESS:  NOT written

# sharing your data with  the NDCN Browser

Now that the data is curated for browsing with the NDCN -Omics Browser it all ready to share.  It could be as simple as zipping the folder and sending, or otherwise moving it to somewhere accessible to whomever you are sharing with.

There's a few more responsibilities that need to be addressed:

1. full context ... the meta-meta-data
2. data safety


## Context & Docuementation

The NDCN Omics browser has a tab to render an .Rmd file containing additional information about your data.  This could include such things as a publication or pre-print, "thank-you"s, acknowledgements, links to the lab, etc.  The goal is to have all the nescessary background and caveats in one place.
