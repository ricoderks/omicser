# Quickstart: NDCN -Omics Browser

These *quickstart* materials are intended to quickly help a user /
curator get the NDCN Omics browser up and running. Contained in this
directory are a sequence of vignettes which detail each step of:

1.  [Environment Setup](01_environment_setup.md)
2.  [Installation](02_install.md)
3.  [Data Curation](03_data_curation.md)
4.  [Configuration](04_configuration.md)
5.  [Browsing](05_browsing.md)

There is also a subdirectory of [`examples/`](examples/) which have some
R-scripts used to curate and execute example datasets, and *stubs* to
some directories holding the curated *DATABASE* examples and
configuration files (e.g.Â [`omicser_options.yml`](omicser_options.yml))

Get started with [Environment Setup](00_start_here.Rmd)
